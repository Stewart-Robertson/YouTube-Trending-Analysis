# YouTube-Trending-Analysis

I decided to work on this project after finding the data on Kaggle. I had never worked with YouTube data before and wanted to, mainly from personal curiosity.

I also wanted to take on a Machine Learning task in the notebook, whether it could be done with the data as it was or not.

It turned out that the task was a little too ambitious for the data that were available (too many classes, not enough features) but it was insightful nonetheless.

I decided to work on this project after finding the data on Kaggle. I had never worked with YouTube data before and wanted to, mainly from personal curiosity.

I also wanted to take on a Machine Learning task in the notebook, whether it could be done with the data as it was or not.

It turned out that the ML task was a little too ambitious for the data that were available (18 classes and only 5 suitable features) but it was insightful nonetheless.

## Note
The interactive 3D projection does not show on GitHub, but does work on Jupyter. The directory "figures" contains the missing projection image, but it is not interactive.
